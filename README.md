# EMPLOYEE TRACKER

## Description
Are you a manager that needs to keep track of your employees, well never again, as the new employee tracker assists you in using and creating your own employee tracker, a way to manage and add employees to your buisness. The primary motivation behind this project was to correct and build a proper and consistent build for creating employees and managing id numbers and security detail. This is useful as it prevents people from being blindsided by new unknown employees and assigns them id numbers and creates a managerial system for them to run. I had trouble with fs for a bit but now I understand the premise and logic somewhat behind fs.
